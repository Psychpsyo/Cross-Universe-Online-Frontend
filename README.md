# Cross Universe Online Battle
This is the frontend for the website running at https://battle.crossuniverse.net.

## Contributing
I am open to contributions of any kind but please ask beforehand, in case it is something that is already being worked on or something that would bring larger changes to the codebase with it.  
To do this, you can simply [open an issue](https://github.com/Psychpsyo/Cross-Universe-Online-Frontend/issues/new).  
This way you'll know your PR can get accepted once you submit it.  

This doesn't apply to minor bugfixes, you'll probably be fine without coordinating those in advance.

## Translating
If you are looking to write translations for this, please go to [this repo](https://github.com/Psychpsyo/Cross-Universe-Online-translations).  
It has more info and any changes over there will be pulled into the master branch here as well.

## Development Setup
1. Fork and clone this repo to your machine.
2. Install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
3. Run `pythonServer.bat` (or `pythonServer.sh` on linux) from the `Website` folder.
4. Point your browser to `http://localhost:8000/`.

## LICENSE

Even though the code in this repo is licensed under the MIT License, the copyright for the Cross Universe card game itself belongs to [Cross Universe](https://crossuniverse.jp/).  
That means the MIT license cannot cover parts of the game itself such as the rules, card backs and the field graphic.  
Those fall under Cross Universe's own license which can be found here: https://crossuniverse.jp/約束事/

They are included in this repo despite that since the code would break without them.
